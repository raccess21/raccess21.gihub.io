    "In the annals of canine mythology, there exists a legendary figure known as Dolchi, the 553 Dog God who lived by the side of the Cannal canal of the canine kingdom of Ka-us-tri. Revered by dogs of all breeds and sizes, Dolchi was believed to be the epitome of virtue and heroism. According to ancient tales passed down through generations, Dolchi played a pivotal role in saving his fellow dogs from the wrath of Dhelma, the demon dog, on Judgment Day.",
    "As the appointed guardian of dogkind, Dolchi stood vigilant against the looming threat of Dhelma, a malevolent entity hell bent on unleashing chaos and destruction upon the world of dogs and making it all grey like himself. When Judgment Day arrived and Dhelma's dark shadow loomed large over the canine realm, Dolchi knew that he must act swiftly and decisively to protect his brethren. With unwavering courage and selflessness, Dolchi staked all the good deeds he had ever done in his life as a wager against Dhelma, challenging the demon dog to a final showdown.",
    "In a climactic battle that raged across the heavens, Dolchi and Dhelma clashed in a titanic struggle for the fate of dogkind. With each blow exchanged, Dolchi fought valiantly, drawing upon his boundless reserves of strength and determination. In the end, it was Dolchi's indomitable spirit and unwavering faith in the righteousness of his cause that emerged victorious, vanquishing Dhelma and banishing the specter of darkness from the land.",
    "However, despite his heroism and sacrifice, Dolchi's triumph was short-lived. In the aftermath of the battle, jealousy and resentment festered among the other dogs, who found it difficult to coexist alongside such a noble and revered figure. Fearing that Dolchi's presence would cast a shadow over their own achievements and virtues, they decreed that he must be exiled from their midst, condemned to wander the world alone for all eternity. As Dolchi departed from the company of his fellow dogs, so too did all the colors from their lives. From that day onwards, the world appeared to them in shades of grey, devoid of the vibrant hues and hues they had once known.",
    "The story of Dolchi the 553 Dog God serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities of heroism and the fickleness of adulation. Despite his noble deeds and selfless sacrifice, Dolchi was ultimately cast out by those he had sworn to protect, a victim of jealousy and ingratitude. Yet, even in exile, Dolchi's legend lives on as a symbol of courage, selflessness, and unwavering devotion for dogs everywhere, Dolchi remains a beacon of hope and inspiration, a reminder that true heroism lies not in glory or adulation, but in the quiet strength of character and the willingness to sacrifice for the greater good.",
    "Ironically, the legend of Dolchi is captured in the beautiful lines of Dushyant Kumar, <br><a class='aInArticle' href='http://kavitakosh.org/kk/%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%81_%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8B_%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%AF_%E0%A4%A5%E0%A4%BE_%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%81_%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%B0_%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95_%E0%A4%98%E0%A4%B0_%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%87_%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%87_/_%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%A4_%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0 target='_blank''>\"Kahan to tay tha charagaa har ek ghar ke liye<br>Kahan Charaag Mayassar nahin sheher ke liye\"</a>"
